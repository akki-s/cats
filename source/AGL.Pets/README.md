##Assumptions
- When two owners of same gender have a cat with same name, then sort by owner name
- When there are no cats for a given gender, don't show that gender.
- When there are cats where owner gender is not specified, group them under empty string gender in Api. On the UI show it as Unspecified
- When there's no owner name, then show it as empty.
- When there's no cat name, then return it as empty in Api. In UI show it as 'a cat'.
